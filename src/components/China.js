        <div className="usa1">
        <h6>The government started granting subsidies to EV buyers in 2010, to level the price difference with combustion vehicles, and to support commercialisation. Originally set to stop at the end of 2020, the subsidy was extended to 2022 due to the pandemic and its economic impact.<br/>An even stronger policy would be to ban the sale of combustion vehicles. This is a controversial matter in China but local governments could lead the way.<br/>Chinaâ€™s policymakers planned to phase out the subsidies at the end of 2022 and instead impose a mandate on car manufacturers. Simply stated, the mandate requires that a certain percent of all vehicles sold by a manufacturer each year must be battery-powered.</h6>

            <p>In this graph, the Production units of evs have been mentioned. The Chinese government has initially provided subsidies to develop the infrastructure for electric vehicles. Later on by 2022, the government decided to reduce the subsidies to reduce the burden on the government. Further due to this, there has been a constant rise in the production of evs in China which is greater than even the rest of the world. </p>

            <p>With the rise in subsidies, the charging infrastructure saw a tremendous rise in its numbers. The constant support from the government led to such a rise. In 20212 only 17000 charging stations were there in China but due to consistent support from the government in the form of refined policies the numbers jumped to 300,000 in 2018 and facilities have improved. </p>
